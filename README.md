1. [Motivation](#intro)

My brother is starting a graduate program in data science, and over the course
of discussing what he needs to know before beginning, I realized compiling it
all into a living document makes more sense. This guide is the result of that
discussion, incorporating all of the tools and resources I have found helpful
over the course of a PhD in a data science related field. The focus of the guide
is on scientific rigor, reproducibility, and clarity of communication in the field of data science, but directed towards a novice in the field. 

2. [Background Mathematics](#math)
4. [Programming](#programming)
5. [Visualization](#visualization)
